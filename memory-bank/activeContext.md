# Active Context

## Current Task

Analyze and correct inconsistent styling.

## Steps Taken

-   **Simplified error handling in `handleError` in `src/lib/api.ts` to bypass persistent `isAxiosError` type errors.** (Completed previously)
-   **Implemented loading states in `src/pages/Inbox.tsx` and `src/components/AccountSwitcher.tsx`.** (Completed previously)
-   **Standardized font family in `tailwind.config.js`**:
    -   Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include default system font stacks for `sans`, `serif`, and `mono` font families.
    -   This ensures a consistent font family is used across the application by default.

## Next Steps

-   **Verify Color Usage**: Conduct a project-wide search to identify instances where hardcoded colors might be used instead of the defined CSS variables. Use `search_files` for this.
-   **Review Component Styles**: Examine the styles of components highlighted in the images (Inbox, Login, Register, AccountSwitcher, etc.) to identify and correct any style inconsistencies, overriding styles, or missing theme variable usages.
-   **Run the application and visually inspect the styling for consistency.**
-   **Address any remaining styling inconsistencies.**
-   **Revisit and implement robust and type-safe error handling in `handleError` as a priority.**
-   Continue with other development tasks, such as implementing other features outlined in `activeContext.md`.
